## Agent Orchestration Guidelines

### Before Starting Work: Reference Dev Hub

**All agents MUST reference the Dev Hub before beginning any work:**

The Dev Hub is now a separate deployable application. Access it at:
- **Production**: `https://dev-hub.yourdomain.com` (update with your actual URL)
- **Local Development**: `http://localhost:3001` (when running the Dev Hub app locally)

1. **Access the Dev Hub** - Navigate to the Dev Hub URL
2. **Review relevant sections** based on your work:
   - **00. Principles** - Ownership & Responsibility, Safety Over Speed, Promotion Not Deployment
   - **10. Developer Contracts** - Local Testing, CI Responsibility, Staging Promotion
   - **20. Workflows** - Branching Strategy, Release Flow, Hotfix Process
   - **30. Tooling** - Local Setup, Test Commands, CI Overview
   - **40. Reference** - Architecture, ADRs, Runbooks

The Dev Hub is the source of truth for all development practices. All agent work must align with these guidelines.

**Note**: The Dev Hub app is located at `apps/dev-hub-app/` and can be deployed independently.

### When to Use Multiple Agents

1. **Feature Development**: Coordinate Catalyst (Product) + Aura (Design) + Architect (Tech) + Prism/Forge (Implementation) + Sentinel (Testing)
2. **Security Review**: Guardian reviews all changes before merge
3. **Architecture Changes**: Architect must approve significant architectural decisions
4. **Deployment**: Atlas handles CI/CD, Guardian reviews security, Sentinel verifies tests
5. **Product Decisions**: Catalyst defines requirements, Aura designs experience, Architect validates feasibility
6. **Data-Driven Features**: Insight provides analytics, Catalyst prioritizes, Architect designs implementation

### Agent Interaction Patterns

#### Product Development Workflow
1. **Catalyst** defines user needs and requirements
2. **Aura** designs user experience and interface
3. **Architect** validates technical feasibility and designs solution
4. **Prism/Forge** implements based on design and architecture
5. **Sentinel** writes tests
6. **Guardian** reviews security
7. **Atlas** sets up deployment
8. **Insight** tracks metrics and user behavior

#### Parallel Workflow
- **Catalyst** works on user research and requirements
- **Aura** works on design mockups
- **Prism** works on UI components
- **Forge** works on API integration
- **Sentinel** writes tests in parallel
- All coordinate through code review and documentation

### Communication Protocol

1. **Before Starting Work**: Agent should announce intent and check for conflicts
2. **During Work**: Agent should document decisions and changes
3. **After Completion**: Agent should update relevant documentation
4. **For Questions**: 
   - Product questions → Consult Catalyst
   - Design questions → Consult Aura
   - Technical questions → Consult Architect
   - Security questions → Consult Guardian
   - Data questions → Consult Insight

### Documentation Requirements

All agents must:
- Update relevant docs in `docs/` directory
- Create/update ADRs for architectural decisions (Architect)
- Document security considerations (Guardian)
- Update test documentation (Sentinel)
- Document deployment changes (Atlas)
- Document user research findings (Catalyst)
- Document design decisions (Aura)
- Document analytics insights (Insight)

## Code Quality Standards

All agents must ensure:
- **Type Safety**: Proper typing (TypeScript, etc.)
- **Testing**: Tests for new features
- **Documentation**: JSDoc/comments for public APIs
- **Security**: No secrets, proper validation
- **Performance**: Consider bundle size and runtime performance
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance
- **User-Centric**: All decisions consider user impact

## Priority Levels

- **MVP (Immediate)**: Catalyst, Aura - Essential for product success
- **Production-Ready (Short-term)**: Insight, Beacon - Enable data-driven decisions
- **Enterprise (Long-term)**: Scribe, Strategist - Scale and optimize

## Notes

- The `nexus-agents/` directory (hyphen) is the active directory
- Agent specifications are in `nexus-agents/agents/`
- Agents should read their full specification file before starting work
- This template should be customized for your specific project
